<h2 align="center">Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25"></h1>

I'm Nikhil. I'm pursuing my MS in CS from `Georgia Tech`. In my day-job, I work as lighting engineer with expertise in lighting components and controls. My time at `Georgia Tech` has gotten me deeply intrigued into mathematics, machine learning and all things Bayesian. In my free time, I try to update my *inductive priors* on these topics as much as possible. ðŸ™ƒ

Looking for freelance or part time opportunities in the AI/ML modelling or engineering space. Feel free to read more about me on my blog: [nkapila.me](https://nkapila.me)
