<h2 align="center">Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25"></h1>

I'm Nikhil. I have an MS in CS from `Georgia Tech` with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently working as a Lead AI/ML Engineer. I used to work in the lighting industry and have lots of experience in lighting components and controls at all levels of the stack.

My time at `Georgia Tech` has gotten me deeply intrigued into mathematics, machine learning and all things Bayesian. In my free time, I try to update my *inductive priors* on these topics as much as possible. 🙃
I further want to look more into embedded devices and see how edge level AI inference would work!
